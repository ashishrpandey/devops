## Adding a slave/node/Agent

# Also refer to this link:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/jenkins-on-aws/worker-nodes.html

## Delegation for tasks between master and agent is fairly automatic
## However you can dictate if you want a particular agent for specific job
 su jenkins -s /bin/bash
 ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:

Create a slave server
ssh to slave
sudo su
useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
vi /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
--- Copy the earlier generated key from master ----
install java on this slave

rpm -Uvh jdk-8u121-linux-x-64.rpm
alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/latest/bin/java 200000
alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/java/latest/bin/javac 200000

export JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/latest"

Go to master
manage-jenkins->manage nodes->new node
--give a name to slave and add as permanent agent
configure slave:
Remote root directory: /var/lib/jenkins
